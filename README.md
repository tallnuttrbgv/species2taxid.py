# species2taxid.py
Gets the NCBI TaxID and full taxonomy from species name.
See script for usage example.
tax2lin.txt is a local version of NCBI taxonomy to speed up the script so it does not have to download data for already searched species names. This can be cleared if a new taxonomy is required for a species. To search plants only use 'Viridiplantae' in extra terms command option.
